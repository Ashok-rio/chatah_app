Light is an electromagnetic wave, where an oscillating electric field generates a changing magnetic field, which in turn creates an electric field, and so on. Electrical generators work by a spinning magnetic field creating a current in a nearby wire. Other example like Electromagnetism is also responsible for the electricity powering your screen and the device you're reading on, with the flow of electrons propelled energy.",
